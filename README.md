# music-for-humans

Music for humans is a subscription based music streaming service for independent artists.

The goal of this service is to maximize the income that artists make from streaming their music.

Revenue will be distributed to artists based on the following formula:

```
Artist revenue = ((Your money - our running costs) / the number of songs you stream per month) * the number of that artist's songs that you stream in the same month.
```

Example

Let's say the service costs 1 dollar, and our running expenses are 10 cents. You listen to 100 songs in a month, 20 of those listens belong to artist A, 40 to artist B, and 40 to artist c.

```
Artist A: ((1 - .1)/100) * 20 = $0.18
Artists B and C: ((1 - .1)/100) * 40 = $0.36
```

This means that the act of listening to an artist is now also an act of supporting their career, directly.
